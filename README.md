# Sloads Demo â€¢ [![tests](https://github.com/0xevm/sloads_demo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?label=tests)](https://github.com/0xevm/sloads_demo/actions/workflows/ci.yml) ![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/0xevm/sloads_demo?label=license) ![solidity](https://img.shields.io/badge/solidity-^0.8.19-green)

A demo for test smart contract's dynamic data's storage slot's, such as array, map, using [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/).

### Usage

**Install Forge**

see https://getfoundry.sh/

**Building & Testing**

```sh
$ forge build

$ forge test -vvv
```

**Get the storage slot**
```sh
$ forge inspect ./src/RecordMapping.sol:RecordMapping storage --pretty
```

**Debug to see the stack&memory&storage**

```sh
$ forge test --debug testRecordMapping
```

**Test with new Forge**
```sh
$ cd foundry/

$ cargo build --release -p foundry-cli --bin forge   



$ cd sloads_demo/

# !! update the PATH to your foundry build release path
$ export PATH="/Users/flyq/workspace/github/0xevm/foundry/target/release:$PATH"

$ forge clean

$ forge install 0xevm/forge-std-new

$ forge test -vvv

```

### New cheatcode

```solidity
    /// Let foundry-evm start recording Storage slot related data.
    function startMappingRecording() external;

    /// Get the length of a map in a smart contract.
    /// @param `target`, the address of smart contract.
    /// @param `slot`, the slot of a map or a array.
    function getMappingLength(address target, bytes32 slot) external returns (uint);
    /// Get the storage slot index of one item of a map
    function getMappingSlotAt(address target, bytes32 slot, uint256 idx) external returns (bytes32);
    /// 
    function getMappingKeyOf(address target, bytes32 slot) external returns (uint);
    /// Get the slot below which map in a contract
    function getMappingParentOf(address target, bytes32 slot) external returns (bytes32);
```

### Todo
update the interface name, as they also can used in array.
