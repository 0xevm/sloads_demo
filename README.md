A demo for test smart contract's dynamic data's storage slot's, such as array, map, using [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/).

### Usage

**Install Modified Forge**

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/0xevm/foundry.git

$ cd foundry
  
$ git checkout beijing-eth

$ cargo build --release -p foundry-cli --bin forge

# !! update the PATH to your foundry build release path
$ export PATH="/Users/flyq/workspace/github/0xevm/foundry/target/release:$PATH"

# confirm the forge is the modified forge
$ which forge
/Users/flyq/workspace/github/0xevm/foundry/target/release/forge
```

**Building & Testing**

```sh
$ forge build

$ forge test -vvv
```

**Get the storage slot**
```sh
$ forge inspect ./src/RecordMapping.sol:RecordMapping storage --pretty
| Name       | Type                                         | Slot | Offset | Bytes | Contract                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| length     | int256                                       | 0    | 0      | 32    | src/RecordMapping.sol:RecordMapping |
| data       | mapping(address => int256)                   | 1    | 0      | 32    | src/RecordMapping.sol:RecordMapping |
| nestedData | mapping(int256 => mapping(int256 => int256)) | 2    | 0      | 32    | src/RecordMapping.sol:RecordMapping |
```

**Debug to see the stack&memory&storage**

```sh
$ forge test --debug testRecordMapping
```

### New cheatcode

```solidity
    /// Let foundry-evm start recording Storage slot related data.
    function startMappingRecording() external;

    /// Get the length of a map in a smart contract.
    /// @param `target`, the address of smart contract.
    /// @param `slot`, the slot of a map or a array.
    function getMappingLength(address target, bytes32 slot) external returns (uint);

    /// Get the storage slot index of one item of a map
    function getMappingSlotAt(address target, bytes32 slot, uint256 idx) external returns (bytes32);

    /// Get the map item's key in the slot.
    function getMappingKeyOf(address target, bytes32 slot) external returns (uint);
    
    /// Get the slot below which map in a contract
    function getMappingParentOf(address target, bytes32 slot) external returns (bytes32);
```

### Todo
update the interface name, as they also can used in array.
